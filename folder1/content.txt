Motion Design System

In the "Hidden Layers" project, our team developed a cohesive motion design system for the 2024 Design & AI Conference. 
We reinterpreted the institution’s corporate identity to create a flexible design framework, setting clear guidelines for visual elements, motion, and composition. My primary role was in the conceptual phase, where I helped shape the overall look and feel by defining the visual rules.

Production

During production, I focused on creating generative background visuals based on our motion design system, establishing the foundation for the conference’s visual identity. In the role of creative director, I contributed by overseeing the organization and coordination of the production process to ensure consistency and timely delivery.
